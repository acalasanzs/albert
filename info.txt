Ecclesiastes 2:15
Seeing the futility of pleasure and the building of great works, Solomon looked at those who had human wisdom, including himself, and the results in this life to the person who has become known for his wisdom. He expressed the situation that he then faced:So, even though an objective may be commendable, a pursuit of it to the point of neglecting our own really important interests, not allowing ourselves time or opportunity to think of what God has in mind as to mankindâ€™s future, actually ends up in vanity. Certainly the world goes on unthankful, and eventually forgetful and unappreciative. And finally the individual has gone out of existence.
